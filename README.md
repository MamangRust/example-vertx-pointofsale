# Vert.x CRUD Example

This is a comprehensive REST API project built with Vert.x and Java, showcasing a clean architecture and modern development practices. It implements a full-featured CRUD application with authentication, role-based access control, and a complete observability stack.

This project has been significantly updated to include Docker for containerization, Flyway for database migrations, and a suite of observability tools.

## Features

-   **Authentication:** User registration and login with JWT (JSON Web Token).
-   **Authorization:** Role-based access control (e.g., admin, user).
-   **CRUD Operations:** Full Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for users and roles.
-   **Database Migrations:** Automated database schema management using Flyway.
-   **Containerized:** Ready to run with Docker and Docker Compose.
-   **Observability:** Integrated with Prometheus for metrics, Loki for logging, and Grafana for visualization.
-   **API Testing:** Comes with `hurl` scripts for easy API endpoint testing.
-   **Clean Architecture:** Well-organized folder structure for better maintainability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Java 17+
-   Maven 3.8+
-   Docker and Docker Compose

### Running with Docker Compose (Recommended)

This is the easiest way to get the entire stack up and running, including the database, Redis, and observability tools.

1.  **Build the application JAR:**
    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean package
    ```

2.  **Start all services:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8888`.

### Running Locally (for Development)

If you prefer to run the application directly on your machine:

1.  **Start Database and Redis:**
    You can use the `docker-compose.yml` to start only the database and Redis:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d postgres redis
    ```

2.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    ./mvnw clean compile exec:java
    ```

The server will run at `http://localhost:8888`.

## API Testing with Hurl

The `hurl/` directory contains scripts to test the API endpoints.

To run a test, for example `login.hurl`:
```bash
hurl --variable host=http://localhost:8888 hurl/auth/login.hurl
```

## Observability

The included observability stack allows you to monitor the application's health and performance.

-   **Grafana:** `http://localhost:3000` (user: `admin`, password: `admin`)
    -   **Logs Dashboard:** Explore application logs from Loki.
    -   **JVM Dashboard:** Monitor JVM metrics from Prometheus.
-   **Prometheus:** `http://localhost:9090`
-   **Loki:** `http://localhost:3100`

The `observability/` directory contains all the configuration files for these services.
